# Lordo âžŸ Netto

I created this net salary calculator because I was not satisfied with the ones I found on the web. In my opinion, it doesn't have to calculate the pay slip so it doesn't matter if it is accurate to the penny but if it is fast and immediate.

The purpose then is comparison and for it to be effective you need an immediate result.

It is not yet complete and some results need to be verified (especially the company section) but I think it can already be useful. 

You can try it here:
